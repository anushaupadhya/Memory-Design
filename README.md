# Memory-Design
This repo is created in order to document my observations and results while designing a hybrid memory architecture combining SRAM and DRAM with the objective to achieve concurrent read and write operations thereby enhancing the performance and efficiency of the overall system.
I started with designing individual circuits of 1T DRAM and 6T SRAM and verifying the read and write operations of each circuit.
